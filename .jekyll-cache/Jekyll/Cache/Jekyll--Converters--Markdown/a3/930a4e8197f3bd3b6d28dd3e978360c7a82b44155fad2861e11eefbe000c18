<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>I am convinced that as a society, we can grow together by learning from one
another. I love reading great content and thought I could contribute myself as
well. My goal for writing these posts is to really share ideas, insights and
learnings from my experiences (both technical and non-technical). The type of
content you can expect:</p>
<ul>
	<li>machine learning/software development tutorials</li>
	<li>reflections on startup life</li>
	<li>problem solving experience reports</li>
    <li>any other topics that might be interesting to empathy driven development (business/technology)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2>
<p>I have tons of ideas for upcoming posts. Iâ€™m really excited and looking forward
to sharing my experiences and add a bit of life to my static website :)</p>

<p>If you have any feedback or want to get in touch, feel free to do so via social media.</p>
