<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Recently, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have emerged asthe  most  promising
candidates  for  performing  a  wide  range  oftasks such as image
classification and recognition, object detection,speech recognition, and
speech-to-text translation. There have beensignificant improvements in the
classification accuracies of ANNs,and  in  2015,  ANNs  achieved  human-level
accuracy at  theImageNet 2012 Visual Recognition Challenge. However,
thehigh classification performance of ANNs comes at the expenseof a large number
of memory accesses and compute operations,which results in higher power and
energy consumption. Recently,there has been an increased focus on developing
more efficient ANNs.</p>

<h2>What I did</h2>

<p>The main objective of this work is to accelerate the inference of TTFS-based SNNs on low-power devices, with minimal loss to accuracy. Therefore, this work focuses on (1) improving the classification performance of TTFS-based SNNs, and (2) designing a low-power neuromorphic hardware accelerator for performing inference of TTFS-based SNNs. The main contributions of this work can be listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A new training algorithm that reduces the errors accumulated as a result of converting pre-trained neural network models to SNNs.</li> 
    <li> A novel low-power neuromorphic architecture, \nameofwork{} is designed to accelerate the inference operations of TTFS-based SNNs.</li> 
    <li>An end-to-end neuromorphic technique that demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance and accuracy for TTFS-based SNNs.</li> 
</ul>
