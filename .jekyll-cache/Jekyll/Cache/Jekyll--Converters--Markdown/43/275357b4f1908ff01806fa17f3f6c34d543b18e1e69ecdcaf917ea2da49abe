I"x<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>In recent years, along with the rise of machine learning across a wide plethora of applications, we see massive troves of data being collected from individuals. Be it usersâ€™ online activity or diagnosis reports, large amounts of sensitive data are collected by a growing number of institutions, ranging from hospitals and government bodies to private companies and research organizations. This has ushered growing concerns associated with a potential loss of user privacy.</p>

<h1>What I did</h1>

<p>With growing concerns over privacy, this work aims to study privacy preservation
techniques using the differential privacy framework and, draw comparisons
between medical and non-medical datasets from a privacy standpoint. We compare
the use of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent(DP-SGD) and
Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles(PATE) on three publicly available
datasets.</p>
