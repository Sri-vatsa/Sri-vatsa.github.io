I"ê<p>With growing concerns over privacy, this work aims to study privacy preservation
techniques using the differential privacy framework and, draw comparisons
between medical and non-medical datasets from a privacy standpoint. We compare
the use of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent(DP-SGD) and
Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles(PATE) on three publicly available
datasets.</p>
