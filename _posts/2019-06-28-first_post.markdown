## Short Introduction
Welcome! My name is Srivatsa. I am a final year undergraduate student
from <b>Singapore</b> who is currently studying in <b>Germany</b> for a
semester. I am also:
<ul>
	<li>the co-founder <a class="text-link" href="https://www.healthquay.com" target="blank">
@HealthQuay</a> in <b>Spain</b></li>
	<li>shipping code for a startup in the <b>United States of America</b></li>
	<li>working on <b>n</b> other projects</li>
</ul>

## Motivation

I am convinced that as a society, we can grow together by learning from one
another. I love reading great content and thought I could contribute myself as
well. My goal for writing these posts is to really share ideas, insights and
learnings from my experiences (both technical and non-technical). The type of
content you can expect:
<ul>
	<li>machine learning/software development tutorials</li>
	<li>reflections on startup life</li>
	<li>problem solving experience reports</li>
    <li>any other topics that might be interesting to empathy driven development (business/technology)</li>
</ul>


## Wrap up
I have tons of ideas for upcoming posts. I'm really excited and looking forward
to sharing my experiences and add a bit of life to my static website :)
