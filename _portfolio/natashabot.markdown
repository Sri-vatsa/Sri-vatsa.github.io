<h2>The Problem</h2>

Having contributed to several legal education workshops, my team and I became
extremely aware of the common problems faced by blue-collar migrant workers who move to
Singapore. Particularly, many of them were not necessarily aware of the
employment laws that applied to them. Even if they wanted to find out, they had
to either consult their supervisor or navigate pages of government websites only to find general information
that might not directly apply to them. The fact that <u>many of them barely speak
fluent English</u> makes it a lot more difficult for them to understand their rights
and how they can get appropriate legal assistance. 

<h2>What we did</h2>

My interdisciplinary team of engineering students and law students, and I, built a <b>multilingual</b> Facebook chatbot aimed
at addressing common issues and questions faced by new migrant workers who move
to Singapore. Through understanding their problems in the language that they are
most comfortable in, our solution can both respond with personalized
responses and direct migrant workers to relevant resources.
