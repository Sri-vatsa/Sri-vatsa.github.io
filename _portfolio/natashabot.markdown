<h2>The Problem</h2>

We've worked with migrant construction workers before, giving legal education
workshops. Many new migrant workers face problems that can been solved easily had
they had access to the right information regarding employment laws in Singapore.

<h2>What we did</h2>

My team of engineering students and law students, and I, built a <b>multilingual</b> Facebook chatbot aimed
at addressing common issues faced by new migrant workers who move to Singapore.
