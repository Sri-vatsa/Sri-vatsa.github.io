<h2>The Problem</h2>

As of 2020, more than <u>9.6 million people died of cancer</u> around the world.
A number of reasons account for the low survival rate of the cancer patients
with the most critical/ being the lack of access to information on the right
treatment options, at the right time. According to a recent study, close to
<b>61% of cancer patients</b> search for treatment and well-being options
online, when standard therapies fail. However, online search often returns
generic, unreliable, and out-dated information. Patients are left with no
alternatives but to succumb to the illness! According to recent studies the
global economic burden of cancer is close to <b>€2.2 trillion</b>. 

Most of the existing online platforms provide generic information or paid customised
information collected manually. This makes access to cancer care information a
costly and time consuming affair. 

<h2>What we did</h2>

At HealthQuay, we provide cancer patients access to reliable and up-to-date
information on global therapy and well-being options that are best for the
patient using a hybrid approach that combines physician expertise into an
Artificial Intelligence(AI) system. We developed a <u>GDPR-compliant treatment
recommendation system using hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)</u>.

We use AI to automate the data collation process and provide the information for free, ensuring that we can help more patients across the globe, regardless of the patient’s economic status or geographical location, therefore, creating a larger impact! We estimate that our break-through technology will allow patients access to reliable information <b>95%</b> faster than existing platforms, improving survival rates and will reduce the financial burden of cancer patients by approximately <b>€500</b> (average spend by a European patient on seeking one second opinion), leading to an overall saving of <b>€2.1 billion</b> for the <b>4.6 million EU cancer patients</b>.
