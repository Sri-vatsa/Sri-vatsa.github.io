<h2>The problem</h2>

2020 was marked by the virulent COVID'19 pandemic. While some people across the world
have been able to get back to "life as per normal", vulnerable populations who have been hit
the hardest are still struggling to get by. One such group is the chronically
ill patients who have suffered from poor emotional well-being and the shortage of interactions with their physicians. 

<h2>The solution</h2>

I have spearheaded the development of a novel game, built using <b>Unity</b>, to not only <u>assist
patients in managing and sharing their emotional states</u> through
interactive games and journalling, but also allow them to more effectively
communicate any <u>discomfort/side-effects they experience when taking their
medication/vaccine</u>. 

<div class="img_row">
    <img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/portfolio/yumm1.jpeg" alt="Yumm app screenshot" title="Yumm app screenshot"/>
    <img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/portfolio/yumm3.png" alt="Yumm app screenshot" title="Yumm app screenshot" />
    <img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/portfolio/yumm4.png" alt="Yumm app screenshot" title="Yumm app screenshot" />
</div>

Such a solution is extremely valuable for physicians from small and medium
clinics to triage and act quickly if harmful side-effects are noticed. Forming a
habit among patients to share how they are feeling at different points of the
day through a <u>game fosters a positive habit that promotes mental well-being</u>,
especially among the terminally and chronically ill.
