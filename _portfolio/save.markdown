<h2>The Problem</h2>

We as a society are not comfortable donating. Primary reasons include: Futility
thinking, Diffusion of responsibility, and Lack of trust.

<h2>What we did</h2>

We developed a mobile-centric fund-raising application that funnels rounded-up
spare change at each digital transaction to a donation account on the Save platform.

Transparency is a crucial component in encouraging users to donate to charity.
We provide users with quick updates on how the money spent has touched the lives
exactly.

In order to keep the entire process of donating seamless, we have also developed
a charity facing dashboard, making it extremely easy for charities to update
donors on where their money is being used.
