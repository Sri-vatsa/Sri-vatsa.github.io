<h2>The Problem</h2>

Many of the interactions between 6-12 year old children with Down Syndrome and
their family are limited and not always filled with fun. After doing more
thorough research, we found 4 very typical characteristics of children with Down
Syndrome:

<l>
<li>Sociable: They desire and actively attempt to interact with people around them.</li>
<li>Capacity for full emotional range: They can recognize and manage emotions rather well.</li>
<li>Excellent Visual Learning Abilities: Learning by imitation, gestures and sign language are important in their developing years.</li>
<li>Enjoy games and watching videos: They love to immerse themselves in games and videos as much as anyone else.</li>
</l>
<br>
Primarily, the challenges they face can be summarized by the chart below:

<h2>What we did</h2>

We set out to build a mixed reality mulit-player game using custom designed wooden blocks
that can be put together in different combinations to carry out different tasks
in a game on a screen. The goal of this project is to allow children with Down
Syndrome to have an avenue where they can share joyous moments with their
siblings, family and friends.


<h2>How it works</h2>

The wooden blocks that we built were carefully painted with unique colours. This
is so that our in-game machine learning model can identify the position
of the different blocks in space. Depending on how the different blocks are
brought together, the corresponding in-game object can change. Our machine
learning system is able to identify orientation and position of the blocks in
real space, making it an addictive game for almost anyone.
