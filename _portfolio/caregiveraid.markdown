<h2>The Problem</h2>

The cancer journey is one that is debilitating, impairing the quality of life of not
only the individuals diagnosed but also their family members, on whom the
task of caregiving frequently falls. These impairments are particularly
poignant in caregivers of advanced-stage cancer patients, where treatment
options are likely palliative and many display pathological levels of
anticipatory grief. These impairments may be further exacerbated in Asian
societies like Singapore, an island-state in Southeast Asia, where filial piety
necessitates that family members provide the first line of support to a patient. 

<em>Caregivers have often dropped off the deep end and help does not come
easy</em>. Although there is an excess amount of information on Oncology care
available online, such information can often be incomprehensible and confusing.

<h2>What we did</h2>

Acknowledging the problem faced by caregivers, I worked with several seniors to
develop a <u>mobile application that aggregates and presents relevant information</u>
to caregivers.
