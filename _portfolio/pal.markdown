<h2>The Problem</h2>

Amidst a virulent pandemic and an austere economic climate, stress, fear and
worry have pervaded many of our minds. It is more important than ever to promote
mental well-being.

<h2>What we did</h2>

I am currently working in the Fluid Interfaces group at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) on interpretable closed-loop digital behavior
change interventions. We performed ablation studies to both rigorously compare
different <b>sequence to sequence</b> models such as Transformers to represent digital behavior of
individuals, and evaluate exploration strategies to determine optimal
Reinforcement Learning based interventions. In order to provide personalized
<b>context-aware</b> interventions using minimal data, we assessed the applicability of
<b>Contextual Bandits</b> augmented with <b>guided exploration</b>. From conducting user
interviews to engineering and testing our own models and simulated environments,
working in a multi-disciplinary lab taught me that most problems are not
contained in a single field.
