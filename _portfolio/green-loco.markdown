<h2>The Problem</h2>

Humans consume an extremely large amount of energy be it at concerts, parades or
other large scale events. Wouldn't be nice if we could recapture some of that
energy and use it power the next major event in the city?

<h2>What we did</h2>

We designed and built piezoelectric wristbands for participants to wear at runs and
concerts. Inside of each band are piezoelectric crystals as shown in
the diagram below:

Our proposed solution was a finalist at the <b>Singapore Frontier Challenge 2017</b>.
