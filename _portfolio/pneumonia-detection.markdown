<h2>The Problem</h2>
Pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children. However, it receives less than 2% of the global development fund for health. It is also more prevalent in countries where there is insufficient medical expertise and lack of access to radiology diagnostics. Chest x-rays are the most common tool used to diagnose pneumonia. However, understanding chest X-rays require domain expertise and professional radiologists. We applied machine learning so that a computer can be used to detect signs of pneumonia given a chest x-ray, increasing the ease of access to resources for pneumonia detection. 

<h2>What we did</h2>

We successfully implemented and compared three machine learning models: YOLOv3, RetinaNet and
Mask RCNN. We tested and justified their effectiveness on recognising pneumonia
on chest x-rays by using image segmentation and object detection comparing their neural network
architecture and hyperparameters. We presented this work at the 13th National University of Singapore (NUS)
School of Computing Term Project Showcase (STEPs).
